# Baseball Stats
Ongoing project to build a script/program to predict outcomes of baseball games <br />
Working with MLB Api to fetch data <br />
Attempting to implement a loose form of MLOps <br />
Will be using MLFlow to log and track Experiment info and results <br />
Using git and github for VC but may use another tool like DVC <br />
Feel free to give any advice on tools for this project <br />
